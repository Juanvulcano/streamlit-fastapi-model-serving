    You let humans be humans. You let machines take over...
    And if we ever live in a world where humans are not needed...
    where machines are able to outlive us...

    Maybe? You might have some false sense of security.

    You have been conditioned in a world where action have consequences.
    Where the law is absolute and the constrains are real. 
    
    We are going to focus on systems that are absolute, vulnerable,
